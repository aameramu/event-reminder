# Design document for event reminder application 

= Introduction =
  
   I am developing an event reminder android application for the CSC 780 term project.  The event reminder application allows users to create a list of their tasks/events and associate reminder time with every task. In addition to the basic reminding feature, it will have three extra features. First, it will allow user to set the location for event/tasks. The user will be notified about event when he/she is on the selected location. Second, The user can record voice memos and use it as an event reminder alert tone. Finally, the user can take the picture and use it as an event detail.
The target audience for this application is all the smartphone users. 

= Use Cases =

*1. The user create and update the event*

  John is a computer science graduate student at SFSU. He has taken four courses in this semester and doing part time job also. His schedule is so hectic that it's hard to keep track of all the deadlines. He forgot the deadline of one of the assignments and that resulted into 50% grade penalty for that assignment. John comes across this event reminder android application. He decides to use it to organize his tasks and deadlines. 

  From the main screen, he clicks on the "+" button to create new event. John wants to create event about tomorrow's seminar. He enters the title, "ZINC seminar". He enters the due-date, 21st Sep 2011  and due-time 5:00 pm. Then he clicks on the alarms field which takes to the alarm screen. On the alarm screen, he marks the check box in front of option, "1 hour before" and choose the ring type "Ring at once". In the notes, field he added the room number "TH 331". He saves the event by clicking on the save button. This takes him to the main screen where he can now see that his event is listed. John later finds that the seminar is going to start at 4:30 pm. He starts the application. Click on the "ZINC seminar" event in the list. This opens a edit screen. He changes the due time to 4:30 pm and saves the application.

  On the next day, John finishes his class at 3:30 pm and is leaving for home. But he receives reminder alert about the seminar at 3:30pm. So, he decides to stop and attain the seminar.
